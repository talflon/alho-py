# alho-py
Python GTK+3 interface to Alho personal time-tracking system.

Current goals include:
 - tag-based categorization of how time is spent
 - synchronization between multiple devices
 - offline use
 - simple, intuitive interface (for me)
 - getting it functional enough quickly, to go do more important work!

Possible future goals include:
 - supporting multiple users
